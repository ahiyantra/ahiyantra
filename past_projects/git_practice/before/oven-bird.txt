The Annoying Bird, by Robyn Lost

There is a terrible singer nobody wants to hear,
Loud, a mid-summer waker-upper bird,
Who makes aweful noise all day and night,
Like BAAAAAAAAH! And QUACK!
He says things that make no sense
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BAAAAAH QUACK
On sunny days a moment's CHIRP;
Ruining your poem ruining your poem ruining it, yeah!
This one will never ever ever ever be published, nope!
The bird would CHIRP CHIRP BAAAK!
