Capstone Project Introduction: Colmar Academy
This provides an introduction to the capstone project.

Congratulations, at this point in your coding journey you can create well-designed, responsive websites from scratch, while keeping projects organized with the Git workflow.

You now possess the skills to build websites from scratch! It’s time to apply everything you’ve learned.

Now, you will have the chance to complete a capstone project utilizing all of the skills you’ve learned so far to design and create a responsive landing page.
