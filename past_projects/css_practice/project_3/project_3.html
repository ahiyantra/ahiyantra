The Box Model: The Box Model: Davie's BurgersBrief
Objective
INTERMEDIATE CSS: LAYOUT AND POSITIONING
The Box Model: Davie's Burgers
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a fictional restaurant’s website. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, but the box model properties have yet to be set. You’ll use knowledge of height, width, padding, border, and margin to complete this project.

The website’s existing index.html and style.css files are displayed in the text editor to the right. As you work, use both to see which elements you are selecting and styling. Most of the elements that you’ll need to add styles for already have rule sets in style.css to which you can add additional declarations.

With a 500-pixel height for .content, some elements will overflow out of its box if the browser window is made too small.

Make .content scrollable with the overflow property.
Resize the browser window so it is very skinny and notice that this section is now scrollable.

Good job—this menu item is looking great, and the layout and spacing is much more readable. If you’d like, you can continue refining the design or add your own spin!
