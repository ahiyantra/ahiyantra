Learn Intermediate CSS: Flexbox: To-Do AppBrief
Objective
LEARN INTERMEDIATE CSS
Flexbox: To-Do App
In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a to-do web app. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, however, a few Flexbox values are missing.

In order to complete this project, you must know how to set an element’s Flexbox properties.

We recommend that you review our Flexbox Lesson before beginning.

The website’s existing index.html and style.css files are displayed in the text editor to the right. Good luck!

If you get stuck during this project, check out the project walkthrough video which can be found in the help menu.

Tasks

1.
Start off by turning some of the elements into flex and inline-flex containers.

Turn elements with the class container and elements with the class square into flex containers.
Turn elements with the class week and elements with the class reminders into inline-flex containers.
To do this, add the display property with a value of either flex or inline-flex.


Hint
The .container and .square rulesets get the declaration:

  display: flex;
The .week and .reminders rulesets get the declaration:

  display: inline-flex;
2.
The elements inside the new inline-flex containers should grow to fill the container. This is accomplished using the flex-grow property:

Elements with the class week will get a flex-grow property with a value of 3.
Elements with the class reminders will get a flex-grow property with a value of 2.

Hint
The .week ruleset declaration should be:

  flex-grow: 3;
The .reminders ruleset declaration should be:

  flex-grow: 2;
3.
We want the flex items with the class week to be ordered vertically, instead of horizontally.

Inside the .week ruleset, add a flex-direction property with the value that orders the items in a column.


Hint
The flex-direction property gets the value column.

4.
The items with the class row should move to the next line when the container gets too small.

Inside the .row ruleset, add a flex-wrap property with the value that moves items to the next row, while keeping their order intact.


Hint
The value wrap will move items to the next row.

5.
The items with the class row also need some space:

Inside the .row ruleset, add a justify-content property with the value that adds space around each item.

Furthermore, the items with the class square need to be centered:

Inside the .square ruleset, add a justify-content property with the value that centers the items in the container.


Hint
To add space around items, use the space-around value.

To center the items, use the center value.

6.
Lastly, the elements with the class row and elements with the class square need to be aligned vertically:

Inside the rulesets for .row and .square, add the align-items property with the value that centers the items inside the container.

You did it! Great work. Now resize the browser to see your flex properties in action!


Hint
The align-items property gets a value of center in order to center the items!
