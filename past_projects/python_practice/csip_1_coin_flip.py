Project: Coin Flip
This project will take you off-platform and get you started in your own developer environment! Never done that before? Not to worry - we’ve shared some resources to help you down below. This project can be completed entirely on your own - or, you can join the #comp-science channel in our Community Discord 65 and find someone to work with! Jump to the community support section to hear more about this.

The project is broken down into a set of user stories 128 for you to follow. User stories are likely something you will see more and more of as you progress in your journey as a developer. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the individual using that feature. The goal of each user story is to describe to you, the developer, what the feature or application needs to do, while providing you with enough flexibility to determine the best way to make that happen.

Overview
Objective
Build a console application that allows the user to guess the outcome of a random coin flip.

Pre-requisites
In order to complete this project, we suggest that you have familiarity with the content in the following courses or lessons from the Codecademy Computer Science Path 77:

Milestone 1

Syntax 74

Functions 16

Milestone 2

Command line 77

Milestone 3

Control flow 22

Loops 25

Suggested Technologies
Depending on where you are on your Path, there may be multiple technology options you can use to complete this project - we suggest the following:

Python
Command Line
Project Tasks
Get started - setting up your project
Since you won’t be completing this project in the Codecademy learning environment, you’ll need to find somewhere else to host your project! We’ve listed our recommendations below. For additional set-up information and guidance, please refer to the general resources section below.

Repl.it 118: If you’re not quite ready to get into all of the nitty gritty details of setting up your own local developer environment, Repl.it is an amazing online tool that can help you spin up a web-based development environment with the click of a button. For this project, you’ll need a Repl.it environment that supports Python 3.
Visual Studio Code: If you’re excited & ready to set-up your own local environment, we’ve got your back too. Visual Studio Code is a popular open source text editor that you will set-up & configure on your own device and can be used to develop websites and applications locally before pushing to production.
Basic Requirements
User Story: As a user I want to be able to guess the outcome of a random coin flip(heads/tails).
User Story: As a user I want to clearly see the result of the coin flip.
User Story: As a user I want to clearly see whether or not I guessed correctly.
Additional Challenges
Intermediate Challenge

User Story: As a user I want to clearly see the updated guess history (correct count/total count).
User Story: As a user I want to be able to quit the game or go again after each cycle.
Advanced Challenge

Let’s see if we can expand upon this challenge - what if instead of 2 options, there were 6?

User Story: As a user I want to be able to guess the outcome of a 6-sided dice roll (1-6), with the same feature set as the coin flip (see above).

You can add this directly to the existing program you’ve already written! As an additional challenge see if you can build the program such that the the user can choose between the two guessing games at startup, and possibly even switch after each cycle.
