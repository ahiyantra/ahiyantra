# tips & tricks
## python three

you can use "None" in place of "True" with an "if" statement in python

you can use the returned value from a method (a class function) in place of "True" with a "while" statement in python

the result of "list(zip(list0, list1)" is apparently the same as that of "dict.items()"

base case = base step; recursive case = recursive step

"not list" -> "len(list) == 0" -> list is empty

"not variable" -> "variable == None" -> variable is empty

"not None" = "True"?

you can use "None" in place of "False" with a "while" statement in python

you can use a list (any variable?) containing values in place of "True" with an "if" statement in python

"not xyz" is "True" when "not xyz" is "None" and "False" otherwise

"xyz" is "False" with "xyz" is "None" and "True" otherwise

you can use a comma to separate dissimilar value types with a space without converting any of them in  a "print" statement in python
