git reset --soft HEAD~1

When specifying the “–soft” option, Git is instructed not to modify the files in the working directory or in the index at all.

git reset --hard HEAD~1

Be careful when using “–hard” : changes will be removed from the working directory and from the index, you will lose all modifications.
