Project: Fibonacci Numbers
This project will take you off-platform and get you started in your own developer environment! Never done that before? Not to worry - we’ve shared some resources to help you down below. This project can be completed entirely on your own - or, you can join the #computer-science channel in our Community Discord 2 and find someone to work with! Jump to the community support section to hear more about this.

The project is broken down into a set of user stories 10 for you to follow. User stories are likely something you will see more and more of as you progress in your journey as a developer. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the individual using that feature. The goal of each user story is to describe to you, the developer, what the feature or application needs to do, while providing you with enough flexibility to determine the best way to make that happen.

Overview
Objective
Build a console application that allows the user to explore the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the previous two, starting with 0 and 1 (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34…). This sequence has a wide range of applications including random number generators, sorting and compression algorithms.

Prerequisites
In order to complete this project, we suggest that you have familiarity with the content in the following courses or lessons from the Codecademy Computer Science Path 1:

Section 1

Suggested Technologies
Depending on where you are on your Path, there may be multiple technology options you can use to complete this project - we suggest the following:

Python
Command Line
Project Tasks
Get started - setting up your project
Since you won’t be completing this project in the Codecademy learning environment, you’ll need to find somewhere else to host your project! We’ve listed our recommendations below. For additional set-up information and guidance, please refer to the general resources section below.

Repl.it 3: If you’re not quite ready to get into all of the nitty gritty details of setting up your own local developer environment, Repl.it is an amazing online tool that can help you spin one up a web-based development environment with the click of a button. For this project, you’ll need a Repl.it environment that supports Python.
Visual Studio Code: If you’re excited & ready to set-up your own local environment, we’ve got your back too. Visual Studio Code is a popular open source text editor that you will set-up & configure on your own device and can be used to develop websites and applications locally before pushing to production.
Basic Requirements
User Story: As a user I want to be able to input an upper limit and see all Fibonacci numbers up to the specified value.

User Story: As a user I want to be able to quit the program or go again after each cycle.

Additional Challenges
Intermediate Challenge

User Story: As a user I want to be able to input an upper AND a lower limit, and see all Fibonacci numbers in that range.

User Story: As a user I want to be able to input an integer and see whether or not it’s one of the Fibonacci numbers. If it is, I want to see its index in the sequence.

Advanced Challenge

User Story: As a user I want the program to save the output, in addition to printing to console, so that it can be preserved and accessed separately.
