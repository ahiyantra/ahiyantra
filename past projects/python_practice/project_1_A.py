What we are building in this project:
1.
Take a look at the complete alphabet and find your initials. Notice how each block letter is 7x5 and formed by the letter itself.

My initials are S and L, so my initials.py program should output:

 SSS   L
S   S  L
S      L
 SSS   L
    S  L
S   S  L
 SSS   LLLLL
