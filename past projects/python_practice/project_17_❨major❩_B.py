Overview

Welcome to the portfolio project in CS 101: Introduction to Programming!

In this portfolio project, you will research, brainstorm, and build a basic terminal program of your choice for your friends and family to play with. After you finish building the program, you will create a blog post to share the program on a publication of your choice!

Example Project
LHomecook

Project Ideas:
Blackjack
Tic-Tac-Toe
Connect Four
Battleship
Minesweeper
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
Tarot Reading
NYC MetroCard Price Calculator
Mortgage Calculator
Todayâ€™s Horoscope
Your Very Own Text-Based Adventure

Project Objectives:
Build a terminal program using Python
Add at least one interactive feature using input()
Use Git version control
Use the command line and file navigation
Write a technical blog post on the project

Prerequisites:
Python
Git/GitHub
Command Line and File Navigation

Setup

Going off-platform:
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own code editor (we suggest VS Code) and Git version control.

If you need help with your local setup, read our articles about getting started off-platform:

Command Line Interface Setup
If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, review the Git lesson or look at this cheat sheet.

Debugging Tips + Helpful Resources
Feeling stuck? Try the following:

Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like Stack Overflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes theyâ€™ll have examples of what youâ€™re looking for!
Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes youâ€™ll figure out the solution as youâ€™re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.

Note: Your project doesnâ€™t have to look anything like this! It should be unique to your vision.

Project Tasks
Keep track of your progress by dragging each task from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done" as you work on them. You can also click on a task to see more information about it.
To Do

Think of an Idea
Take some time to think of an idea for your project. ðŸ’¡

Some questions you can ask yourself is:

Who do you want to build something for? Yourself? Your friends? Your family? Your co-workers?
What are your/their hobbies?
Do you want to build something more fun or something more useful?

Project Brainstorming
Now that you have an idea, visualize the end result:

What does your program do?
How will it work in a terminal?
Is it one player or two players?
Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.

Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that arenâ€™t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent scope creep.

The following tasks will help you identify natural breakpoints.

Setting up your GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository for this project and add a Python file inside.

Donâ€™t forget to name your file!

Version Control
Set up Git tracking in your directory and make sure to add and commit changes as you make them.

Write Your Program
This is the bulk portion of your project.

Start with creating the variables that you need and then text prompts that will the user understand what the program is.

Refactoring
Now that you have a working program, try to go back to it see what you can do better?

Can you add some functions to make the code more byte-sized?
Can you add a class & object somewhere?

Blog Post
Once youâ€™ve completed the program, youâ€™re ready to create your blog post.
