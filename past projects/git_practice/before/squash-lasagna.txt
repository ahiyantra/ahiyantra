Vegetarian Butternut Squash Lasagna

Ingredients:

3 3-pound squash, washed and cut into 1/2 inch cubes
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Large crystal sea salt and freshly ground pepper
1/2 cup butter
teaspoon of nutmeg
1/2 cup whole wheat or quinoa flour
2 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
4 cups goat milk
3/4 cup (lightly packed) fresh basil leaves
20 no-boil lasagna noodles
cup grated Parmesan

Instructions:

Heat oil large pan over low heat. Shake salt and pepper over pan. Add squash cubes. Splash water into pan then sautee until squash is tender, about 30 minutes. Smoosh butternut squash cubes in blender, or food processor or with hands. Season squash mush with additional salt and pepper. Don't oversalt, don't undersalt. Just salt enough. And as for the pepper? Seriously, go nuts. Don't put any nuts in the lasagna though. Unless you think that would be good and you're not serving it to anyone with a nut allergy.
