Learn HTML: New York City BlogBrief
Objective
LEARN HTML
New York City Blog
After researching New York City, you decide to create a blog for your viewers who want to know more about the city. It’s time to create a blog to show off how amazing the Big Apple is. You got this!

Don’t forget to save your code after each step. By pressing save to run your code you will see the changes you’ve made in the browser.

Note: While you are developing the webpage, you will notice that the elements are automatically assigned colors, borders, and positioned properly. This is because of the CSS file. Don’t worry about CSS right now, it’s only there so that the webpage looks nice.

Navigation Bar
1.
A common usage of a navigation bar is to create shortcuts for a webpage. This will allow the user to go directly to the information they want to access through the navigation links.

Create a <nav> element underneath the opening <body> tag.


Hint
The <nav> tag would go inside the <body> element like so:

<body>
  <nav>
  </nav>
</body>
2.
Within the <nav> element, create a <ul> element to create an unordered list.

The unordered list should contain the following three items:

Blog
Media
About
Use an <li> element with <a href=""></a> nested within the <li> element to link the content to the nav bar. You may notice that the navbar doesn’t work right now but don’t worry, once the content is added, the navbar will be fully functional!

Note: Save your work to see your progress.


Hint
To add an item to a list, you can use the following code:

<li><a href="#item_name">insert_item_name</a></li>
href will contain a # followed by the name of an id. The id is important as it allows us to target a specific element. You will create the id later in the code.

Blog Content
3.
You need to title your blog, so people know what you’re writing about. Create a <header> element under the closing </nav> tag.

Within the <header> element, create an <h1> element which should contain the following:

New York City

Hint
Make sure created the <header> element right below the closing </nav> element. The <h1> element should be nested within <header> like so;

<header>
  <h1></h1>
</header>
4.
Create a <main> element below the closing </header> tag.

Within the <main> element, create a <section> element with an id of “blog”.

This <section> element will hold the main content of your webpage. You are giving this element an id so that you can target it with the nav bar.


Hint
Remember that <main> contains the bulk of the content that the user focuses on the most.

To create a <section> with an id of “potato”:

<main>
  <section id="potato">
    <!-- potato content to come! -->
  </section>
</main>
5.
Create an <article> element within the <section> element.

Then, create a <p> element within <article> that has the following:

New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.
Note: Save your work to see your progress.


Hint
The <article> element should be nested within <section> element and look like this:

<article>
  <p></p>
</article>
6.
Now that our blog has some content, the next step is adding media to enhance our blog.

You can do this by using the <figure> element. Under the closing </section> tag create a <figure> element.


Hint
<figure> has both an opening and closing tag. Make sure you have a closing tag and that it’s indented properly.

7.
Create an <img> tag within <figure> and use the following link as the src:

https://content.codecademy.com/courses/Semantic%20HTML/statue-of-liberty.jpeg


Hint
<img> is a self closing tag and should be nested within figure like so:

<figure>
  <img src="">
</figure>
8.
Let’s describe the image for those who don’t know what statue this is!

Using <figcaption> add this description of the image:

This is the Statue of Liberty, a popular tourist attraction located on Ellis Island.
Note: Save your work to see your progress.


Hint
<figcaption> should be inside <figure> underneath the <img> element.

Aside Content
9.
For our blog post, you need to add additional content to enhance the post, you can do this by using the <aside> element.

Under the closing </figure> tag create an <aside> element.

Within <aside>, create a <p> element containing the following information:

New York City is very popular for the variety of great food it has. Some of the top food items in NYC include:

Hint
The <p> element should be nested within <aside> like so:

<aside>
  <p></p>
</aside>
10.
New York is known for its amazing food. Our blog should list some of the top food options in NYC. You can do this by creating an ordered list!

Create an ordered list by using the <ol> element within the <aside> element. In an ordered list the first item is ranked one, the second item is ranked two and so on.

The ordered list should contain the following seven items in this order:

Pizza
Bagels
Burgers and Sandwiches
Ramen
Tacos
Pasta
Desserts
Note: Save your work to see your progress.


Hint
The <ol> should be nested within <aside> like so:

<aside>
  <ol>
  </ol>
</aside>
Make sure the <ol> element is underneath the <p> element that we created previously.

To add items to the list use the <li> element. For example:

<li>Pizza</li>
Media
11.
Right now our blog post consists of only one image. Adding more media can help give a better visual representation of New York. Let’s create a section for the media content.

Create a <section> element with an id of “media” under the closing </aside> tag.

Within the new <section> element, create an <article> element.

Then, create an <h2> element within <article> that says:

The Scenery in NYC

Hint
Remember that to create an id we need to nest it into the opening element. Your <section> element should look something like this:

<section id="chapter">
  ...
</section>
In this case the id is named “chapter”.

Note that you should use the <h2> element instead of another <header> because you never want to use <h1> more than once. After <h1> you should only use <h2> through <h6> as this keeps the hierarchy of the document.

12.
You are going to add a little description to explain the media. Add a <p> element directly underneath the closing </h2> tag but within the <article> element with the following paragraph:

While the view in the city is beautiful, the sounds are not as lovely. Below you'll see an example of the view and the sounds you'll deal with in NYC on a daily basis.
Note: Save your work to see your progress.


Hint
Make sure that the <p> element is directly underneath the closing </h2> tag but is still nested within the <article> element.

13.
New York City has a beautiful skyline, so let’s show that with a video.

Under the closing </article> tag, create a <video> element with the attribute controls. Use the following URL as the src:

https://content.codecademy.com/courses/Semantic%20HTML/nyc-skyline-timelapse.mp4

Hint
To add a source to a video, you can use the following code:

<video src="video.mp4" controls>
</video>
Don’t forget, <video> requires an opening and closing tag!

14.
During the night time, the New York City skyline can light up the whole sky! This time you are going to use <embed> to display an image of the skyline.

Create an <embed> element under the closing </video> tag. Use the following URL as the src:

https://content.codecademy.com/courses/Semantic%20HTML/nyc-skyline.jpeg

Hint
Embed does not require a closing tag. Therefore the src should be used like so;

<embed src="">
15.
New York City is known as “the city that never sleeps.” At any point in the day, you can hear the traffic as you make your way through the city. Let’s add an audio clip to show how loud NYC can be.

Create an <audio> tag with the attribute controls directly below the <embed> element. (Don’t forget the closing tag.)

Inside the <audio> tag, insert an audio file with the following URL as the src:

https://content.codecademy.com/courses/Semantic%20HTML/nyc-sounds.mov

Note: Save your work to see your progress.


Hint
There are two ways you can approach this task. The first way is by using src= as shown below:

<audio controls src="song.mp3">
</audio>
The second way is by using <source> as shown below:

<audio controls>
  <source src="song.mp3">
</audio>
Footer
16.
At the bottom of a page, you can add a footer to credit you for the creation of this blog!

Create a <footer> element with an id of “about” under the closing </main> tag.

Inside, add the following content:

A <p> tag with “Posted by:” followed by your name.
A <p> tag that provides one type of contact information for people to reach you at. For example:
Contact information: Blogger@NYC.com

Hint
Remember that to create an id, it needs to be placed in the opening tag of the element.

The structure of an id is:

id="_insert_id_name_"
Each <p> element should be nested within the <footer>.

The Endgame!
