Learn A-Frame (VR): Solar System (Part II)Brief
Objective
LEARN A-FRAME (VR)
Solar System (Part II)
The planetary system that we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

Solar

Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

But what would your solar system look like?

In this project, we will add textures, sky, texts, animations, and more in index.html.

Note: This is part 2 of a cumulative project in three parts. In parts 2 & 3, we will add textures and animations to the solar system.

Part I. Creating the solar system.
Part II: Polishing.
Part III: Add interactions.

Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
Grabbing the code:
1.
Because this is a cumulative project, we are going to grab the code from Solar System (Part I).

Make sure to copy and paste the code in here.


Hint
You can also use the starting code in the code editor, too.

Adding textures to the planets:
2.
Let’s add some image textures for our planets!

Add an <a-assets> element in <a-scene> to use A-Frame’s asset management system.


Hint
A-frame has an asset management system that makes complex environments with multiple parts load faster. The system makes it easier for the browser to cache assets and A-Frame will make sure all of the assets are fetched before rendering.

To utilize the asset management system, all we need is an <a-assets> element around every HTML element we want to include in the asset management system:

<a-scene>
  <a-assets>
    <!-- Asset management system -->
  </a-assets>
 
  <!-- Rest of <a-scene> -->
3.
Here are some of the skins that we made for you. They should already be your folder:

sun.jpg
mercury.jpg
venus.jpg
earth.jpg
mars.jpg
jupiter.jpg
uranus.jpg
neptune.jpg
Feel free to use these or find other texture images on Google.

Add them to the asset management system.


Hint
You could do this one multiple lines:

<a-assets>
  <img 
    id="sun" 
    src="sun.jpg">
</a-assets>
Or in one line:

<a-assets>
  <img id="sun" src="sun.jpg">
</a-assets>
4.
Now we have all the textures in the asset management system, let’s use them for your planets!

Delete the color component of each of your <a-sphere> planets and add a src of the image texture id. Remember to add the # before the id name.


Hint
<!-- Asset management system -->
<a-assets>
  <img 
    id="sun" 
    src="sun.jpg">
  <!-- more assets-->
</a-assets>
 
<!-- Sun -->
<a-sphere 
  src="#sun"
  position="-13 2 -10" 
  radius="4"></a-sphere>
Extra touches:
5.
Add an <a-sky> with the following image or one of your choosing:

space.jpg

Hint
Don’t forget to include the file in the asset management system first.

6.
Add one or more light sources with <a-light>.


Hint
Point lights are like light bulbs; we can position them around the scene, and the effect of the point light on an entity depends on its distance to the entity:

<a-light 
  type="point" 
  intensity="2" 
  position="2 4 4"></a-light>
7.
Add the name of each planet using <a-text>. Or a story about the solar system.


Hint
Here’s an example using <a-text>:

<a-text 
  value="Earth"
  color="#BBB"
  position="-0.9 0.2 -3"
  scale="1.5 1.5 1.5"></a-text>
8.
The outer space is a vacuum, but for our solar system, there’s sound!

Find a sound clip online and add it to your solar system.

Animations:
9.
Almost all of the planets in our solar system rotate in a counter-clockwise motion. The two anomalies in question are Venus and Uranus. These planets rotate in the clockwise or retrograde direction.

Use the animation component to add some rotational animation.

Fun fact: A single day on Venus is longer than an Earth year! It takes 243 Earth days to complete a Venus rotation (but it only takes 224.7 days to complete each orbit).


Hint
It should look something like:

<!-- Earth -->
<a-sphere 
  src="#earth"
  position="-3 2 -15" 
  radius=".5"
  animation="property: object3D.rotation.y;
    to: 360;
    dur: 10000;
    loop: true">
</a-sphere>
