Learn A-Frame (VR): Solar System (Part I)Brief
Objective
LEARN A-FRAME (VR)
Solar System (Part I)
The planetary system that we call home is located in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

Solar

Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity — the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, dwarf planets such as Pluto, dozens of moons and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids.

But what would your solar system look like?

In this project, build your very own solar system in index.html using A-Frame!

Note: This is part 1 of a cumulative project in three parts. In parts 2 & 3, we will add textures and animations to the solar system.

Setting up:
1.
Let’s create a skeleton for the program:

<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Header section -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The Body -->
  </body>
</html>

2.
In the <head> element, add a <script> element with a src source attribute that points to the URL of the external A-Frame file:

https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js

3.
In the <body> element, add the <a-scene> element with a background color.

Planets!

Take a moment to sketch out what you want your solar system to look like. It doesn’t have to look like our solar system - in fact, it can look however you’d like!

Your planets could be boxes instead of spheres, they could bunch together or be miles and miles apart. Also, think about the other elements of the solar system:

Are there moons orbiting some of your planets?
Are there asteroid belts? Space junk?”

5.
Now it’s time to build your solar system.

If your planets are spheres, create them using the <a-sphere> primitive. If you have non-spherical planets in the solar system, what other primitives might you use? How could you combine primitives to create new shapes?

P.S. If you make something cool, share it with us!
