LEARN THE COMMAND LINE
Artusi
Let’s use commands we just learned to manipulate the files and directories of Artusi, an arts supply Store.

Tasks
26/26 Complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
1.
Print the working directory.


Hint
To print out the current directory you are in, use

pwd
2.
List all contents in the current directory, including hidden files and directories.


Hint
To display a directory’s contents, use ls. Since we want to also include hidden files, we can use the option -a.

ls -a
3.
List all contents, in long format.


Hint
To display a directory’s contents, use ls. Since we want to list with long format, we can use the option -l.

ls -l
4.
List all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.


Hint
Since we want to list all directories, including hidden ones, in long format, and sorted by last time modified, we can combine the options -a, -l, and -t, making -alt.

ls -alt
5.
Change directories to the pencils/ directory. The relative path of the pencils directory is drawing/pencils/.


Hint
The current directory is

/home/ccuser/workspace/artusi
and from our ls command, we know drawing/ is a directory inside the current directory. Since we’re told pencils/ is inside drawing/, we simply need to change directory like so:

cd drawing/pencils
6.
List all contents in the current working directly, including hidden files and directories.


Hint
To display a directory’s contents, use ls. Since we want to also include hidden files, we can use the option -a.

ls -a
7.
Copy the file color.txt to graphite.txt.


Hint
Use the cp command. We have a source file color.txt and a destination file graphite.txt, so we can use cp like so:

cp color.txt graphite.txt
You can use the following commands to confirm the result of the above cp statement:

cat color.txt
and

cat graphite.txt
(cat is a command that outputs the contents of a file)

8.
Change directories into the charcoal/ directory. The relative path to the charcoal directory is ../charcoal/.


Hint
The current directory is

/home/ccuser/workspace/artusi/drawing/pencils
charcoal/ is another directory inside the directory drawing/. That means we need to go up a directory level to drawing/ using .., and from there go into charcoals/. So our cd statement would be:

cd ../charcoals
9.
Copy the file compressed.txt to vine.txt.


Hint
Use the cp command. We have a source file compressed.txt and a destination file vine.txt, so we can use cp like so:

cp compressed.txt vine.txt
You can use the following commands to confirm the result of the above cp statement:

cat compressed.txt
and

cat vine.txt
10.
Copy the file vine.txt to pencils/color.txt. The relative path of the latter is ../pencils/color.txt.


Hint
Use the cp command. We have a source file vine.txt and a destination file ../pencils/color.txt, so we can use cp like so:

cp vine.txt ../pencils/color.txt
You can use the following commands to confirm the result of the above cp statement:

cat vine.txt
and

cat ../pencils/color.txt
11.
From the charcoal/ directory, change directories to the painting/ directory. The relative path is ../../painting/.


Hint
The current directory is

/home/ccuser/workspace/artusi/drawing/charcoal/
painting/ is another directory inside the directory artusi/. That means we need to go up two directory levels to artusi/ using ../.., and from there go into painting/. So our cd statement would be:

cd ../../painting
12.
Print the working directory.


Hint
To print out the current directory you are in, use

pwd
13.
List all contents, in long format, including the hidden files and directories, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.


Hint
Since we want to list all directories, including hidden ones, in long format, and sorted by last time modified, we can combine the options -a, -l, and -t, making -alt.

ls -alt
14.
Change directories to the brushes/ directory.


Hint
The current directory is

/home/ccuser/workspace/artusi/painting
and from our ls command from the last step, we know brushes/ is a directory inside the current directory. So our cd command would simply be this:

cd brushes
15.
List all contents, in long format, including the hidden files and directories, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.


Hint
Use ls and combine the options -a, -l, and -t, making -alt.

ls -alt
16.
Copy the files starting with the letter f from the brushes/ directory to the paint/ directory. The path to the paint/ directory is ../paint/.

Without changing directories, list the files and directories of the paint/ directory.


Hint
First, let’s copy the files using cp.

The source file(s) are all .txt files starting with f, which we can shorthand as f*.txt (* is wildcard).
The destination is ../paint/
Putting it all together, the cp command would be:

cp f*.txt ../paint/
To look at the ../paint/ directory, use ls.

ls ../paint/
What you see should confirm that your cp command worked!

17.
Change directories to the sculpting/ directory. The relative path is ../../sculpting/


Hint
The current directory is

/home/ccuser/workspace/artusi/painting/brushes/
sculpting/ is another directory inside the directory artusi/. That means we need to go up two directory levels to artusi/ using ../.., and from there go into sculpting/. So our cd statement would be:

cd ../../sculpting. 
18.
List all contents, in long format, including the hidden files and directories, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.


Hint
Use ls and combine the options -a, -l, and -t, making -alt.

ls -alt
19.
Change directories into the clay/polymer/ directory, and list all contents of the directory.


Hint
The current directory is

/home/ccuser/workspace/artusi/sculpting
clay/ is a directory inside the current one so we can change directories like so:

cd clay/polymer
Now view the contents in the current directory:

ls
20.
Move airdry.txt into the ceramic/ directory. The relative path to the is ../ceramic/.


Hint
Use the mv command to move a file without making a copy. We have a file to move called airdry.txt and a destination ../ceramic/, so we can put together a command like so:

mv airdry.txt ../ceramic/
You can use the following commands to confirm the result of the above move:

ls
to make sure airdry.txt is no longer in the current directory and

ls ../ceramic/
to see airdry.txt in the destination directory.

21.
Change directories into the ceramic/ directory.


Hint
As the step before mentioned, the relative path to ceramic/ is ../ceramic/. so we can change directories like so:

cd ../ceramic
You can confirm you changed into the correct directory using

pwd
22.
List all contents, including hidden files and directories.


Hint
To display a directory’s contents, use ls. Since we want to also include hidden files, we can use the option -a.

ls -a
23.
Remove earthenware.txt from the current directory.


Hint
To remove a single file, we can use the rm command. This current directory contains earthenware.txt, so we don’t need to specify a path.

rm earthenware.txt
You can confirm the removal of the file using

ls
to see the updated contents of the directory.

24.
Change directories one level up back to the clay/ directory.


Hint
To change directories one level up, we can use cd with ..

cd ..
You can confirm you changed into the correct directory using

pwd
25.
Take a look at the contents of the current directory clay/. Delete the dough/ directory.


Hint
To remove a directory, we should use the rm command with the option -r, which deletes the directory and all its contents (even directories nested inside). We could combine the option -r with the option -f, which will delete forcibly without individually confirming each piece of content inside the directory.

Since dough/ is a directory, our command would look like this:

rm -rf dough
26.
Change directories two levels up back to the artusi/ directory. Print the working directory.


Hint
To change directories two levels up, we can use cd with two ..s separated by a /:

cd ../..
Let’s confirm the current directory using

pwd
Terminal


Artusi
