The font size of the rating should be increased within the rating section.

Now the page looks better on large screens. When the page is resized to a smaller width, the page needs to resize and reorganize its elements using media queries.

Write a media query that targets the screen when its width is under 960 pixels and smaller.

When the page is resized to a width less than 960 pixels, note that the navigation bar has empty space above it. Within the media query you wrote in the last step, set the top padding of the .main class to 0.

Resize the browser from large to small. Notice that the coffee beans image in the supporting section causes the supporting paragraph to become too thin.

Write a media query for screens under 700 pixels.

The images in the gallery are too small for small screens.

Select the images in the gallery and style them so that they fill the width of the screen.

Then set their margin to 0 so they span across the entire page.

14.
The footer’s text is not formatted correctly on small screen sizes.

Hide the nav inside the footer to appear better on small screens.

Then, resize the screen from small to large and watch your website change its appearance to best fit the screen size. You just built a responsive website!
