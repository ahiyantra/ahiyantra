Start by making the header section stand out a bit more. Select the .header element, and make its background color CornflowerBlue by using the background-color property.

The .about-me paragraph looks a little dark against the light blue background, maybe it would look nice if it blended more with the background.

Within the .about-me selector, use the opacity property to make it 50% transparent.
