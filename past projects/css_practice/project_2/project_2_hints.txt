Tasks
9/9 Complete
Mark the tasks as complete by checking them off
1.
Look over index.html to review the different HTML elements you have to work with, then navigate to style.css.

Start by making the header section stand out a bit more. Select the .header element, and make its background color CornflowerBlue by using the background-color property.


Hint
The background-color property’’s syntax looks like:

.class-name {
  background-color: CornflowerBlue;
}
2.
Now change how the text is aligned in the top .header section.

In your .header rule set, align the text in the center using the text-align property.


Hint
The text-align property can align text to the left, right, or in the center.

3.
Next, use CSS to make the paragraph below Olivia’s name have a larger text size.

In style.css, select the .about-me element, and set its font-size property to 20px.


Hint
The font-size property follows this syntax:

selector {
  font-size: 15px;
}
4.
The .about-me paragraph looks a little dark against the light blue background, maybe it would look nice if it blended more with the background.

Within the .about-me selector, use the opacity property to make it 50% transparent.


Hint
To make an element 50% transparent, use a value of 0.5 for the opacity property.

5.
In the Projects section, make the section titles bold.

Select the .title elements, and add a font-weight property to make their text bold.


Hint
To bold an element’s text, follow this syntax:

.class-name {
  font-weight: bold;
}
6.
Change the main title color so that it matches the background color more nicely. Set the color for h1 elements to Azure.


Hint
The syntax to set text color for an element is:

selector {
 color: ColorName;
}
7.
Instead of the page being in the default Times font, change the font of the entire page.

Select the body element and make the font-family of the page Georgia.


Hint
You can select the body element with:

body {
 
}
Then, set the font-family property with:

font-family: Georgia;
8.
Finally, let’s make the background of the page more interesting.

Within the body selector, set the background-image property to this URL:

Hint
When using an image with background-image, you need to put it inside url() like this:

selector {
  background-image: url('https://example.com/images/image.png');
}
