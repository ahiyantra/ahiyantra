### About

I'm a software development engineer striving to create likeable products & services. My interests lie mainly in web/game development, with a specialization in the field of "extended reality" (also known as "augmented/mixed/virtual reality"). I'm also interested in robotics & simulations. I've completed my college education for a bachelor's of technology in biotechnology (engineering degree). I'm constantly working on improving my understanding of web/game development & associated topics. My hobbies include reading in general & learning new things. I believe that possessing a rational, utilitarian, practical & realistic approach is important. I occasionally work on research topics that are relevant to me. My mindset as a professional includes not minding either traveling or relocating if my responsibilities require me to, since I'm always interested in experiencing an adventure. If something about me piques your curiosity, then please feel free to contact me about it. Other than that, I recommend checking out my various personal projects.
