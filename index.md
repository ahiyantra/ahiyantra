### About

Hello netizen! I'm a unity developer. My interest lies mostly in unity engine application development, with some interest in "life extension" (also known as "experimental gerontology" & "biomedical gerontology"). I've completed my education for a bachelor of technology in biotechnology. I'm also constantly working on improving my understanding of the unity engine application development field. My hobbies are reading/writing in general & learning new skills. I believe that possessing a rational, utilitarian, practical & realistic approach is important. I occasionally work on research topics that are relevant to me. If i pique your curiosity, then always feel free to contact me about it. Other than that, I also recommend checking out my personal projects.

"There's always a first time. Everyone starts somewhere & becoming a beginner is the first step towards becoming an expert."
