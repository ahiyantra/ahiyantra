## Engineer | Web, Game, Simulation & XR

### Introduction:

I'm a software engineer with academic research & commercial work experience, striving to create likeable products & services. My skills are mainly in full-stack (front-end/back-end) web & game (unity/unreal) development. I've worked on computer simulation & extended reality (augmented/mixed/virtual reality) projects. I'm interested in robotics & artificial intelligence. I can be described as adept at working with Python, Visual Studio, dot NET, Unity, C# and Git (other than some additional ones — such as JavaScript, SQL, Bash, Linux, Unreal, ROS and C++) through Agile and DevOps methods. I've a Bachelor of Technology (a general technology & engineering degree with a specialization, 4 years long, 2016 - 2020) for biotechnology & bioinformatics from Amity University, Uttar Pradesh (AUUP). I'm fluent in English. I've basic knowledge of German & Japanese cultures & languages due to personal interest. I'm learning the Japanese language from The Japan Foundation's e-learning platform, Minato & Marugoto. I'm also learning the Gazebo simulator for robotic simulation. I started a Master of Engineering for information technologies at Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies (LBTU) in September of 2023. 

I constantly work on improving my understanding of full-stack web & game programming. My hobbies include reading, learning & machines in general. My mindset as a professional includes not minding either traveling or relocating when required. I'm prepared for experiencing adventures. I feel that going through a new experience is never a bad thing. If something about my profile piques your curiosity, then please feel free to contact me about it. Other than that, I recommend checking out my various personal & professional projects.
